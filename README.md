# PEV coalitions

This repository contains the source files (in NetLogo) of our research on Coalitions of Plugin Electric Vehicles. The idea of forming such coalitions is to enable such PEVs to form Virtual Power Plants so as to increase their profit when selling energy (through Vehicle-To-Grid sessions) to the smart grid. A list of papers resulting from this research is shown below.

This repository contains three algorithms:
* *Dynamic Constrained Coalition Formation* (DCCF), introduced in [3]. See folder `jbcs`.
* *Self-adapting Coalition Formation* (SACF), introduced in [4]. See folder `saso`.
* *Self-adapting Coalition Formation with Changing Coalitions* (SACF<sup>+</sup>), introduced in [2]. See folder `mags`.

:::warning
Important! The implementations in this repository are compatible with NetLogo 5.3.1 and may not work on later versions.
